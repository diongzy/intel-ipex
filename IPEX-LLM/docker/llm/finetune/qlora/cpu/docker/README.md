## Fine-tune LLM with IPEX LLM Container

The following shows how to fine-tune LLM with Quantization (QLoRA built on IPEX-LLM 4bit optimizations) in a docker environment, which is accelerated by Intel CPU.

### 1. Prepare Docker Image

You can download directly from Dockerhub like:

```bash
# For standalone
docker pull intelanalytics/ipex-llm-finetune-qlora-cpu-standalone:2.1.0-SNAPSHOT


Or build the image from source:

```bash
# For standalone
export HTTP_PROXY=your_http_proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY=your_https_proxy

docker build \
  --build-arg http_proxy=${HTTP_PROXY} \
  --build-arg https_proxy=${HTTPS_PROXY} \
  -t intelanalytics/ipex-llm-finetune-qlora-cpu-standalone:2.1.0-SNAPSHOT \
  -f ./Dockerfile .


### 2. Prepare Base Model, Data and Container

```bash
export BASE_MODE_PATH=your_downloaded_base_model_path
export DATA_PATH=your_downloaded_data_path
export HTTP_PROXY=your_http_proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY=your_https_proxy

docker run -itd \
   --net=host \
   --name=ipex-llm-fintune-qlora-cpu \
   -e http_proxy=${HTTP_PROXY} \
   -e https_proxy=${HTTPS_PROXY} \
   -v $BASE_MODE_PATH:/ipex_llm/model \
   -v $DATA_PATH:/ipex_llm/data/alpaca-cleaned \
   intelanalytics/ipex-llm-finetune-qlora-cpu-standalone:2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

The download and mount of base model and data to a docker container demonstrates a standard fine-tuning process. You can skip this step for a quick start, and in this way, the fine-tuning codes will automatically download the needed files:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=your_http_proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY=your_https_proxy

docker run -itd \
   --net=host \
   --name=ipex-llm-fintune-qlora-cpu \
   -e http_proxy=${HTTP_PROXY} \
   -e https_proxy=${HTTPS_PROXY} \
   intelanalytics/ipex-llm-finetune-qlora-cpu-standalone:2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

However, we do recommend you to handle them manually, because the automatical download can be blocked by Internet access and Huggingface authentication etc. according to different environment, and the manual method allows you to fine-tune in a custom way (with different base model and dataset).

### 3. Start Fine-Tuning (Local Mode)

Enter the running container:

```bash
docker exec -it ipex-llm-fintune-qlora-cpu bash
```

Then, start QLoRA fine-tuning:
If the machine memory is not enough, you can try to set `use_gradient_checkpointing=True`.

```bash
cd /ipex_llm
bash start-qlora-finetuning-on-cpu.sh
```
